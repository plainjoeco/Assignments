READ ME for Executing run_Analysis on any machine
========================================================

### Running the script

1. First thing to be done is fork the repository on your machine.
2. Download the entire 'Assignment' folder on your local machine. This folder has all the markdown documents, script file and the dataset used in analysis.
3. Set the Working Directory to the path where this folder was downloaded. For this just change the first line in 'run_Analysis.R' by giving the path to your directory where the data was downloaded.
4. Once the above is done you can execute the 'run_Analysis.R' script from R-Studio or R Console.
5. If step 4 is done successful you will see a file called 'new_tidy_data.txt' inside your working directory. This will be outside the Assignment folder.
6. For more details on how the script works please refer to CodeBook.md file in this same folder.
